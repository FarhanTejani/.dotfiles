# My Dotfiles

## macOS

To use, first make sure you have an up-to-date system with Apple's developer tools installed:

```sh
$ sudo softwareupdate -i -a
$ xcode-select --install
```

You may need to restart your computer after executing the commands above. After they're done:

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
2. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (`brew install git`)
3. Clone this repository
4. `cd` to the `.dotfiles` directory created by cloning this repository
5. `sh install-osx.sh`
6. `sh setup.sh`

Enjoy my dotfiles!
